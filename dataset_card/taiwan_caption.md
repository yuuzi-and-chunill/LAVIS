## Description
A collection of taiwan sightseeing pictures.

## Task

(from https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-captioning)

**Image captioning** is the task of describing the content of an image in words. This task lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Most image captioning systems use an encoder-decoder framework, where an input image is encoded into an intermediate representation of the information in the image, and then decoded into a descriptive text sequence.

## Metrics
Models are typically evaluated according to a [BLEU](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040/) or [CIDER](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Vedantam_CIDEr_Consensus-Based_Image_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) metric.
